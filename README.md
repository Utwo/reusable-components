The aim of the project is to publish a distribution of reusable frontend components that can be imported, customized and used in any Code4Romania project that would require them.

[See the project live](https://reusable-components-peach.vercel.app/)

As part of our ongoing development, we discovered that it is a lot simpler to develop frontend components that we can later customize and import in other projects, rather then reinventing and redeveloping the same components all over again in every project. This also helps us to aim for the same look and feel across projects.

Help us out by testing this project in the [staging environment](https://reusable-components-peach.vercel.app/). If you see something that doesn't quite work the way you expect it to, open an Issue. Make sure to describe what you _expect to happen_ and _what is actually happening_ in detail.

If you would like to suggest new functionality, open an Issue and mark it as a __[Feature request]__. Please be specific about why you think this functionality will be of use. If you can, please include some visual description of what you would like the UI to look like, if you are suggesting new UI elements.

## Built With

### Programming languages

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

### Frontend framework

[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)

### Package managers

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

## Development

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. (optional) Add a Here Maps API Key to your environment

In order for components that require maps to work, get an API key by signing up at https://developer.here.com, then add it to your env vars or to `.env`:

```
echo "STORYBOOK_HEREMAPS_API_KEY=your-api-key-goes-here" >> .env
```

3. Run storybook

```
npm run-script storybook
```

Preview environments available automatically on each PR powered by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Preview environment for `master` branch: https://reusable-components-peach.vercel.app/

## Usage

### CSS and theming

All the components in this repo are themed using [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). In case you need to override any component's styles, pass the `classes` prop to any component individually or pass a theme to a `<ThemeProvider>`. See [theme.tsx](src/util/theme.tsx) for more details.

### CSS injection order

By default, CSS for these components is injected at the end of `<head>`. In case you want to override the CSS rules of this library, you might want to inject them earlier (before your own CSS). To do that, add a `<!--!code4ro-style-inject-->` comment to your `<head>` where you want this library to inject its CSS.

### Here Maps API key

When using components that contain maps, you'll need to provide a Here Maps API key:

```
<HereMapsAPIKeyProvider value="yourAPIKeyHere">
  {/*...*/}
</HereMapsAPIKeyProvider>
```
